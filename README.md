# Beautiful Output
This role ships with a callback plugin to allow you to display the execution of
your playbook in a beautiful way (in my opinion.)

I was always obsessed about the looks of my terminal, and when I started using
Ansible, there was no Callback available that looked good enough for my taste.
Faced with such scenario, I spent some time to create this plugin to satisfy my
_"beautiful terminal"_ goal with Ansible.

It is worth notice that taste is a subjective point, and what looks good for
me is not necessarily good for you.

## Requirements
The control machine has to have the `watchdog` python libraries installed prior
of running your playbook with this callback setup.

You can install it using pip:

```sh
$ pip install watchdog
```

Or add it to your `requirements.txt` file.

If you're running this on a macOS, `watchdog` requires the package `AppKit` installed, but do not install it directly, add the `PyObjC` and `PyObjC-core` packages instead:

``` sh
$ pip install PyObjC PyObjC-core
```

## Dependencies
No dependency to any other Role.

## How to use it
First, let Ansible know that you will use the plugin as an `stdout_callback` plugin on your
`ansible.cfg` file:

```ini
[defaults]
# Use the Beautiful Output callback plugin.
stdout_callback = beautiful_output
# Use the stdout_callback when running ad-hoc commands.
bin_ansible_callbacks = True
```

Then, for each playbook you want running with this callback plugin, add the
role on the playbook file:

```yaml
    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: townk.beautiful_output
```
